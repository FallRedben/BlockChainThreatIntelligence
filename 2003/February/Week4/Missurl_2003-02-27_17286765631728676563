During this period, cryptographers from over 10 countries have submitted and audited 42 crypto algorithms. Out of all the submissions, 17 final algorithms have been selected and published as the results.\nParticipants of NESSIE\nThe project was coordinated by the Katholieke Universiteit Leuven (Belgium) and the following universities, institutes, companies and participants took part:\nKatholieke Universiteit Leuven\n, Belgium\nBart Preneel\nAlex Biryukov\nAntoon Bosselaers\nChristophe De Canni\u00e8re\nBart Van Rompay\n\u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure\n, France\nJacques Stern\nLouis Granboulan\nRoyal Holloway, University of London\n, United Kingdom\nSiemens AG\n, Germany\nTechnion \u2013 Israel Institute of Technology\n, Israel\nUniversit\u00e9 Catholique de Louvain\n, Belgium\nJean-Jacques Quisquater\nMathieu Ciet\nFrancesco Sica\nUniversitetet i Bergen\n, Norway\nResults of NESSIE\nThe \nfollowing crypto primitives and algorithms have been published as results of NESSIE\n (underlined means, that the algorithm was already an existing or emerging standard by the time of the project):\nBlock ciphers\nMISTY1 (Mitsubishi Electric Corp., Japan)\nCamellia (Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp., Japan and Mitsubishi Elect ric Corp., Japan)\nSHACAL-2 (Gemplus, France)\nAES (Advanced Encryption Standard)\n (USA FIPS 197)\nPublic-key encryption\nACE Encrypt (IBM Zurich Research Laboratory, Switzerland)\nPSEC-KEM (Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp., Japan)\nRSA-KEM\n (draft of ISO/IEC 18033 -2)\nMAC algorithms and hash functions\nTwo-Track-MAC (K.U.Leuven, Belgium and debis AG, Germany)\nUMAC (Intel Corp., USA, Univ. of Nevada at Reno, USA, IBM Research Laboratory, USA, Technion, Israel and Univ. of California at Davis, USA)\nCBC-MAC\n (ISO/IEC 9797-1)\nHMAC\n (ISO/IEC 9797-1)\nWhirlpool (Scopus Tecnologia S.A., Brazil and K.U.Leuven, Belgium)\nSHA-256, SHA-384 and SHA-512\n (USA FIPS 180-2)\nDigital signature algorithms\nECDSA (Certicom Corp., USA and Certicom Corp., Canada)\nRSA-PSS (RSA Laboratories, USA)\nSFLASH (Schlumberger, France)\nIdentification schemes\nGPS (Ecole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure, Paris, France T\u00e9l\u00e9com and La Poste, France)\nDetails about NESSIE\nOverview of NESSIE\nName\nNew European Schemes for Signatures, Integrity, and Encryption (NESSIE)\nWebsite\ncryptonessie.org\nArchive\narchive.org\nFurther information\nwikipedia.org\nSubmissions\n42 crypto primitives and algorithms\nResults\n17 crypto primitives and algorithms (\narchive.org\n)\nCoordinator\nKatholieke Universiteit Leuven (Belgium)\nStarted\nJanuary 2000\nEnded\nFebruary 2003\nI'm part of the crypto space since 2013 and I strongly believe in it. But I also know how it feels to get scammed and to realize financial losses.
