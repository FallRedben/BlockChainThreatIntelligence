        "original_content": "When a former FBI special agent Ilhwan Yum described how he\u00a0\ntraced\n\u00a03,760 bitcoin transactions over 12 months ending in August 2013 from\u00a0\nSilk Road\n\u00a0servers to Ross Ulbricht\u2019s laptop, it was almost a done deal for Silk Road creator \u201cDread Pirate Roberts\u201d aka Ross Ulbricht.\n\n\nTo accomplish this, Yum followed more than 700,000 bitcoins on the blockchain, from the Silk Road marketplace to Ulbricht\u2019s personal wallets. It was the first time people realized the potential of blockchain analysis to solve a criminal investigation. Today, blockchain analysis technology is used by financial institutions, crypto businesses, and law enforcement authorities to prevent and investigate cryptocurrency crimes worldwide.\n\n\nFinancial Crime in a world of cryptocurrency\n\n\nCryptocurrencies are internet native currencies powered by blockchain technology. All the transactions are visible on the blockchain; however, blockchains do not contain real-world identities. Therefore associating these activities with real-world actors and stopping criminals is an ongoing challenge. \nCrypto trading bots\n and exchanges and other services are generating billions of crypto transactions every day, at the same time getting hacked now and then.\n\n\nWith the rise of new memecoin creation platforms like \nSunpump\n and \nPumpfun\n, the potential for misleading novice investors has significantly increased.\n\n\nBitquery has been investigating funds lost to scams and malicious social engineering schemes, with losses ranging from a few thousand to several million USDT.\n\n\nWhat is the blockchain analysis?\n\n\nBlockchain analysis is a process of investigating, classifying, and monitoring blockchain addresses and transactions to understand the activities of various actors on the blockchain.\n\n\nCrypto businesses must deploy blockchain analysis solutions to be regulatory compliant and prevent the exposure of illicit funds to their businesses.\n\n\nBlockchain analysis tools in a nutshell\n\n\nBlockchain analysis solutions provide a full suite of transaction monitoring, risk assessment, and investigations tools. The core idea is to associate blockchain addresses with real-world identities and provide tools to analyze the transaction activities. The following are the primary functions of a blockchain analysis tool.\n\n\nAddress Classification\n\u200a\u2014\u200aOne of the main applications of blockchain analysis software is to associate blockchain addresses with real-world identities. Without it, nothing will make sense; therefore, these tools apply multiple techniques to identify real-world entities on the blockchain.\n\n\nTransaction monitoring and Risk analysis\n\u200a\u2014\u200aMonitor every transaction related to your businesses and assess risk based on the fund\u2019s origin, money flow, and the history of sender or recipient wallets.\n\n\nInvestigation tools\n\u200a\u2014\u200aprovide visualization tools to investigate transactions and blockchain addresses manually.\n\n\nBlockchain analysis Technology: Under the hood\n\n\nAs we mentioned above, the primary functions of blockchain analysis products, let\u2019s also look at how these products achieve this functionality with technology.\n\n\nClassification and identification\n\u200a\u2014\u200aBlockchain analysis tools use methods like clustering algorithms, web scraping, scam database monitoring, and\u00a0\ndust attacks\n\u00a0to understand the real-world identity of blockchain addresses. Clustering is the most common way using which analysis software identifies entities like exchanges, payment processors, wallets, etc.\n\n\nRisk analysis is performed by creating\n\u00a0risk models and train them using machine learning to provide a risk score to every blockchain transactions. Risk models are based on multiple parameters such as transaction amount, the origin of funds, and money flow history.\n\n\nInvestigation Tools\n\u00a0are the graphic interface representing transaction graphs to understand the association among them.\n\n\nBlockchain analysis use cases and benefits\n\n\nThe most important use case of blockchain analysis is in the regulatory space (RegTech). Crypto businesses and other financial institutions use blockchain analysis software to mitigate risk and become compliant.\n\n\nCompliance\n\n\nBlockchain analysis software helps in enforcing compliance by deploying risk mitigation and monitoring tools for virtual asset service providers. For example, a crypto exchange probably does not want a criminal to use its services to launder money or perform other illicit activities.\n\n\nTherefore, blockchain analysis tools monitor every transaction related to your business and analyze risk associate with those transactions. You can also set various rules and standards to accomplish your regulatory obligations based on your jurisdiction.\n\n\nSurveillance and Investigations\n\n\nBlockchain analysis software plays a critical role in criminal investigations related to cryptocurrencies. It enables law authorities to trace the money and identify criminals. For example, a criminal uses a crypto service to convert funds into fiat. Blockchain analysis tools can identify the crypto services, and if that crypto service implemented a strict KYC solution, then we can identify the actual criminal.\n\n\nBlockchain analysis companies also provide powerful visualization tools for manual investigations and deploy various clustering algorithms to identify crypto services.\n\n\nBest blockchain analysis software and tools\n\n\n\n\nMoneyflow\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMoneyflow by Bitquery is a crypto investigation tool that provides auto-tracing, extensive entity resolution and case management features.\n\n\n\n\nCounterparty Information:\n Moneyflow provides extensive labels on whales, flagged accounts, scams, heists among others, offering good counterparty information.
