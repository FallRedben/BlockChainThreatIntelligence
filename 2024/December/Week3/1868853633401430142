Total Reported Losses:\nOver $500K (Either people are learning or there's a big incident coming)\nIncidents: 1\ufe0f\u20e3 Clober DEX\nExploit Loss: ~$501,000 What happened? A reentrancy vulnerability in Clober\u2019s\nRebalancer contract on the Base Network allowed an attacker to exploit the\nliquidity vault, resulting in a significant loss of roughly 133.7 ETH. The\n_burn() function got burned, and so did the funds.\n2\ufe0f\u20e3 bnbs Reentrancy\nAttack Loss: ~$20,300 What happened? The bnbs token on BSC was hit by a\nreentrancy attack. Just another reminder: a single line of unchecked code can\nlead to major losses. 3\ufe0f\u20e3\nLABUBU Vulnerability Loss: ~$11,900 What happened? LABUBU (LABUBU) on BSC\nencountered a contract vulnerability. Attackers keep sniffing out these weak\nspots, so always do your due diligence.\n4\ufe0f\u20e3 JHY Exploit Loss:\n~$11,200 What happened? JHY token on BSC was exploited via a contract\nvulnerability. Unverified code and quick token launches often spell trouble.\n5\ufe0f\u20e3 DCF Flash Loan Attack\nLoss: ~$8,800 What happened? Decentralized Finance (DCF) on BSC got hit by a\nflash loan attack, demonstrating that even smaller pools aren\u2019t safe from\ncrafty attackers. \u26a0\ufe0f Other\nNotable Incidents: Haven Protocol Vulnerability:Haven Protocol faced a serious\nexploit in \u201crange proof validation,\u201d potentially allowing attackers to mint\nillicit XHV. Exchanges were advised to halt trading. Cardano Foundation\u2019s X\nAccount Compromised:Account takeover continues to be a trend. The Cardano\nFoundation\u2019s X account was compromised, with the community advised to ignore\nposts until the issue was resolved.\n![?](https://abs-0.twimg.com/emoji/v2/svg/1f511.svg) Key Takeaways: Reentrancy\nStrikes Again: Clober and bnbs both fell victim to reentrancy exploits, a\nclassic DeFi vulnerability. Proper contract audits and reentrancy guards are\nmore important than ever. Ongoing Contract Vulnerabilities: From JHY to\nLABUBU, poorly secured contracts remain low-hanging fruit for attackers.\nAlways verify code and trust reputable audits before diving in. Flash Loan\nAttacks: DCF\u2019s incident shows that flash loan attacks are still a weapon of\nchoice. Protocols need robust price oracles and safeguards to mitigate these\nrisks. Account Compromises & Verification: Even big names like the Cardano\nFoundation aren\u2019t immune to account hacks. Users should verify announcements\nthrough multiple channels before taking action. Remember, these are just the\nreported incidents. For more details, check out\n[https://hacked.slowmist.io](https://t.co/e90CSvSOh3). As always, stay\nvigilant!"
